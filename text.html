<h1>Project Brief</h1>
The project brief was based around creating a technological solution for monitoring the treatment of
wastewater. We have decided to develop a website that displays sewage outfall monitoring information
to address the challenges faced by the UK's wastewater treatment facilities. <br><br>
This solution offers real-time data collection, analysis, and reporting capabilities to help reduce the
impact of sewage outfalls on the environment, public health, and the economy.

<h1>The Importance of Proper Sewage Treatment</h1>
Sewage outfalls are a significant environmental concern in the UK. These outfalls release untreated or
poorly treated wastewater into the surrounding waterways, leading to pollution, waterborne diseases,
leading to environmental and economic losses. <br><br>
The public is generally unaware of the impact of sewage outfalls on the environment and
public health. There is a need for a platform to raise awareness about sewage outfalls' impact and
provide real-time information on sewage outfall monitoring for 2 clear markets: <br><br>
1) Clear and open publically available data with the aim of providing accountibility for leading sewage
treatment providers as well as informing the general public ober the contents of their water.<br>
2) For diagnostic use for these major wastewater treatment companies to accuratly assess issues in
current water treatment methods by seeing the data we can provide

        <h1>Suspended Solids</h1>
        - These are small particles that remain suspended in the water and can cause turbidity and reduce the
        amount of light that reaches aquatic plants. <br>
        - Gastrointestinal issues: Ingesting suspended solids in water can cause gastrointestinal problems, such
        as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<br>
        - Increased risk of infection: Suspended solids can provide a surface for bacteria and other pathogens to
        attach to, increasing the risk of infection from waterborne diseases.<br>
        - Damage to internal organs: If the suspended solids are large enough, they can cause physical damage to
        the digestive tract, liver, and other internal organs.<br>
        - Exposure to toxic substances: Suspended solids can also carry toxic substances, such as heavy metals or
        chemicals, which can have harmful effects on the body if ingested.

        <h1>Organic Matter</h1>
        - This can include human waste, food waste, and other biodegradable materials. When this organic matter
        decomposes, it can deplete oxygen levels in the water, which can harm aquatic life.<br>
        - Gastrointestinal issues: Ingesting organic matter in water can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as
        nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<br>
        - Increased risk of infection: Organic matter can provide a food source for bacteria and other pathogens,
        increasing the risk of infection from waterborne diseases.<br>
        - Exposure to toxic substances: Organic matter can carry toxic substances, such as pesticides or
        industrial chemicals, which can have harmful effects on the body if ingested or absorbed through the
        skin.<br>
        - Skin irritation: Contact with organic matter in water can cause skin irritation, such as rashes or
        itching.<br>
        - Increased risk of cancer: Some organic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or
        trihalomethanes (THMs), can increase the risk of cancer if they are ingested over long periods of time.<br>
